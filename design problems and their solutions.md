In this project the main focus was on the backend functionality
and very little effort has been made for the frontend UI

1-The main problem which i faced was about the functionality of showing Analytics.
  i was not sure about which analytics are to be showed and how.
  So i decided to open a new window on the selection of a url from list of URLs   and that windows shows the number of times that URL is used,Usage Percentage of   the selected URL and the expiration time.
  
2-Testing may not be complete so it may contain bugs.

3-I was not sure about how to show a URL functioning so i chose to display the   Short url in a text field and on the clicking of a Button it redirects to the   Original URL and opens it in the computer browser.

4-My main focus was to first satisfy the explained Minimal Requirements.
